# Filesaur
---- For a more current version of this program (that doesn't need batch files) see github.com/vmetric/filesharp -----

This program's end goal is to be capable of manipulating files in many different (and, hopefully, modular) ways, 
such as moving, deleting, etc. using a (very lightweight) GUI frontend and batch file based backend (though the backend may change to C#
should it prove to be as fast). This is to allow for easier, quicker file manipulation without having to run through a batch script in cmd.

Currently supported operations:
Move, delete, sort, and create dummy files.

Filetypes currently supported in sort operation:
JPG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, MP4, AVI, MOV, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, TXT
